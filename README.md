# Paradigms-Laboratory-04_Inheritance_and_Polymorphism
Programming Paradigms Assignment 4

## Problem 1
----
Complete the following classes with suitable data members and methods. In client
program take instance of these classes and demonstrate various functionality of these
objects.

```cpp
Class Vehicle {
  private :
    // Price
    // Manufacturer
  public :
    // Default constructor
    // Parametrized constructor
    // Copy constructor
    // Assignment operator
    // Read data
    // Display data
};

Class Car : public Vehicle {
  private :
    // Color
    // Number Of Seats
    // Model
  public :
    // Default constructor
    // Parametrized constructor
    // Copy constructor
    // Assignment operator
    // Read data
    // Display data
};
```

## Problem 2
Write a program to design Classes for *Student*, *Clerk*, *Professor*. Each of
these Classes should contain below mentioned attributes. Make sure proper class
hierarchy is designed following the principle of inheritance.
Provide a mechanism to display the profile/detail of various kind of Object of these
class.
```cpp
Student : Name, Age, Gender, Dept, Year
Clerk : Name, Age, Gender, WorkLoad, Salary
Professor : Name, Age, Gender, Dept, CourseLoad, Salary
 ```
